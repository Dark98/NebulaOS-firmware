# Writes the custom xImage/rootfs.squashfs to this board's fixed custom-OS
# slot (kernel2/rootfs2, FIRMWARE.md sec 19/23) and verifies every write
# against a checksum before reporting success - deliberately never touches
# the stock slot (kernel/rootfs, p5/p7) and never flips the ota marker
# itself (that's a separate, deliberate step - see S00revert-safety for
# what happens once the custom image actually boots).
#
# Run this ON the device, e.g.:
#   scp flash-spare-slot.sh root@<printer-ip>:/tmp/
#   ssh root@<printer-ip> 'sh /tmp/flash-spare-slot.sh --check-only /path/to/xImage /path/to/rootfs.squashfs [/path/to/build-manifest.txt]'

#
# Every check below aborts loudly rather than guessing or proceeding on a
# mismatch - this script is the one place where a silent mistake could
# overrun into a neighboring partition, so nothing here is allowed to be
# approximate.
#
# 2026-07-23: an optional 3rd argument (build-manifest.txt, produced by
# 05-final-build.sh) is checked against BEFORE writing anything, closing a
# real gap found live - a transfer truncated mid-flight once, leaving a
# bad file on the device that this script's own write-verify loop
# couldn't have caught on its own (it only proves the device matches
# whatever local file it was given, not that the local file matches what
# the build host actually produced).
#
# Final-seal mission (2026-07-27): full rewrite to close a real, live
# safety incident. The previous version's "refuse to write the currently
# booted root" check compared /proc/mounts' root source against the
# target partition - but on this device /proc/mounts reports the root
# source as the literal string "/dev/root", which doesn't even exist as a
# file, so that comparison could never match regardless of which
# partition was actually live. This went unnoticed for the entire prior
# mission because every earlier use happened to run while the device was
# genuinely booted from stock - the custom slot really was idle every
# time, by circumstance, not because the check caught otherwise. The
# first time this script ran again after the device had permanently moved
# to running custom as its steady state, nothing stopped it from writing
# directly onto the live, currently-executing rootfs - a cascade of
# segfaults across running processes (pages faulted in against a backing
# device being concurrently overwritten), requiring a manual power cycle
# to recover. The write itself completed and was verified byte-correct
# afterward (lucky, not safe).
#
# This rewrite: (1) resolves the live root from /proc/cmdline's own
# root= parameter, not /proc/mounts' aliased name; (2) models both real
# slots explicitly and verifies their partlabel symlinks and (where
# checkable) major:minor device identity, rather than trusting hardcoded
# paths blindly; (3) refuses a mixed/inconsistent target kernel+rootfs
# pair, not just a literal match against the live root; (4) provides a
# --check-only preflight mode that performs every destructive-safety
# check with zero writes, used both for standalone qualification and
# (unconditionally) a second time immediately before any real write, so a
# stale check-only pass is never treated as standing authorization; (5)
# fails closed - "unknown" is always a refusal, never "probably safe".
#
# The preflight/decision functions below are also exercised directly by
# tests/flash-spare-slot-preflight-tests.sh, using CMDLINE_PATH/DEV_PREFIX
# overrides to point at fixture files instead of real hardware - the
# exact same functions (and, for the --check-only path specifically, the
# exact same CLI entry point) run in both contexts, so there is only one
# implementation of this safety logic to keep correct. Two independent
# env vars control test behavior:
#   FLASH_SPARE_SLOT_TEST_MODE=1     relaxes is_real_device() to accept
#                                    any existing fixture path instead of
#                                    requiring a real block special file
#                                    (fixtures can't create those without
#                                    root) - safe to set for ANY test,
#                                    including full end-to-end CLI runs.
#   FLASH_SPARE_SLOT_NO_AUTORUN=1    suppresses the auto-call to main()
#                                    at the bottom, for tests that only
#                                    want to source the file and call an
#                                    individual function directly.
