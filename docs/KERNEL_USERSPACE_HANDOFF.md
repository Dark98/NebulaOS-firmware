# Kernel → Userspace Handoff

Kernel work on the Nebula Pad / Ender-3 V3 KE custom Linux 6.6.18-rt23 image ends here. This
document is the single, concise handoff record for whoever picks up userspace work next.

**Classification: `FUNCTIONAL_PRODUCTION_BASELINE`, `KERNEL_HANDOFF_READY`.** Not manufacturing
qualified, not reliability validated, not security hardened, not Bluetooth complete - those are
separate, later milestones.

## Supported product hardware

eMMC · Wi-Fi (BCM43430/1, firmware 7.46.58.13) · display · backlight · touchscreen (`ns2009_ts`) ·
USB · PWM beeper (GPC-3/PWM channel 3, `guppybeep`, direct `/dev/mem` MMIO) · RTC · watchdog ·
rotation (`/dev/video0`) · H.264 encoder (`/dev/video1`) · H.264 decoder (`/dev/video2`) · UART1
printer link (software-equivalent to stock, see `docs/PRINTER_MAINBOARD_PRECONNECTION_CHECKLIST.md`
for the remaining physical-connection sign-off).

## Intentionally unsupported or disabled

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Bluetooth | `uart3` (the real transport pins) guaranteed-conflicts with `i2c4`/touch; needs stock's dynamic pin hand-off mechanism, a separate future mission |
| Ethernet (`mac1`) | Not populated on this product; also had a real GPIO conflict with `lcd_rst` |
| Extra MMC (`msc2`) | Reference-board-only controller, no product storage device |
| SFC flash | No MTD device on stock or custom, no consumer |
| MScaler 0/1 | `v4l2_subdev`-only, zero userspace consumer, unrelated to the real camera/rotation/encode/decode path |
| ALSA/PCM audio (whole graph: `as-platform`, `as-virtual-fe`, `as-fmtcov`, `as-dsp`, `as-baic`, `as-dmic`, `as-mixer`, `as-spdif`, `icodec`, `sound`) | Stock itself never registers a sound card (`ALSA device list: No soundcards found.`, confirmed by booting stock directly); the beeper needs none of it |
| DMIC | No product microphone array; subsumed by the full audio-graph disable |
| BAIC4/SCO | Bluetooth voice backend; subsumed by the full audio-graph disable |
| eFuse | No production consumer, avoids OTP write risk |

## Items transferred to userspace work

- BusyBox executable-stack hardening (`process '/bin/busybox' started with executable stack`) -
  userspace security-hardening item, not a kernel functional blocker.
- Service startup and supervision (init.d ordering, restart policy).
- Application permissions and privilege boundaries.
- `/dev/mem` access used directly by `guppybeep` - works today, but is a raw-hardware-access pattern
  a userspace security review should be aware of.
- Network-service exposure (dropbear, nginx, Moonraker's `trusted_clients`).
- Logging policy and log rotation.
- RTC/NTP policy (RTC currently boots to a fixed epoch until NTP updates it - `S49ntp`).
- OTA user-facing behavior and update UX.
- Configuration migration for existing installs upgrading from stock.
- GUI (GuppyScreen) and Klipper integration/config beyond what's already proven working.

## Kernel limitations retained (accepted, documented, not blockers)

- `IRQ pdmam not found` - optional secondary DMA-MCU interrupt, primary DMA works throughout boot.
- `no trigger-mode IRQ (optional, not used by this board)` (TCU) - severity already corrected to
  `dev_info`; optional second IRQ genuinely unused.
- `vusb_d`/`vusb_a` dummy regulators (USB) - standard-optional names, no board supply defined, rails
  almost certainly fixed/always-on; USB fully functional.
- Static GPIO base allocation deprecation warnings - vendor-kernel-generation characteristic, no
  functional effect.
- `irq_chip XBurst2-irqchip did not update eff. affinity mask` - architecture limitation, both CPUs
  online and functional.
- `Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT.` - confirmed present verbatim on stock too; primary
  GPT and all 10 partitions valid.
- `mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card` - known, benign pre-power-sequencing scan; the
  controlled `WL_REG_ON` sequence immediately after always succeeds.
- CLM/TxCap blobs missing - confirmed genuinely absent from stock's own shipped rootfs (not merely
  unfound); no unproven blob installed.
- `This architecture does not have kernel memory protection.` - real, mainline MIPS port gap, not a
  configuration choice this project can fix.
- Jitterentropy self-test result - timing-dependent (measures live CPU jitter), varies boot to boot;
  hardware TRNG makes the outcome moot either way. See `docs/BOOT_WARNING_AUDIT.md` for the full
  reconciliation of this specific item found during the kernel handoff audit.

## Verification

`scripts/build/06-verify.sh` checks all of the above automatically against the packaged production
DTB (via `dtc`, decompiling the real compiled artifact) and the built rootfs/kernel config - re-run
it after any future kernel change before considering a new baseline handoff-ready.
